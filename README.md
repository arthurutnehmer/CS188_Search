# Pacman Search Algorithms Project

This repository contains the code for Project 1 of the CS 188 Summer 2024 course, where we implemented various search algorithms to help Pacman navigate mazes. The project involves developing depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform-cost search (UCS), A* search, and heuristics to solve different search problems.

## Project Overview

In this project, we designed various search algorithms to enable Pacman to find paths through his maze world efficiently. The tasks involve implementing DFS, BFS, UCS, A* search, and designing heuristics for more complex problems like the Corners Problem and Food Search Problem.

## Setup Instructions

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed. You can use the following command to run Pacman with different search algorithms:

```bash
python pacman.py -h
```

This command shows the various options available for running Pacman, including layout choices and search algorithms.

## Project Details

### 1. Depth First Search (DFS)
Implement the DFS algorithm to help Pacman find a path through the maze. This search method explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.

**Files involved**: `search.py` (depthFirstSearch function)

### 2. Breadth First Search (BFS)
Implement the BFS algorithm, which explores all possible nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

**Files involved**: `search.py` (breadthFirstSearch function)

### 3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
Implement the UCS algorithm, a search method that expands the least cost node, ensuring that the first solution found is the optimal one.

**Files involved**: `search.py` (uniformCostSearch function)

### 4. A* Search
Implement the A* search algorithm, which combines UCS with heuristics to find the most cost-effective path to the goal.

**Files involved**: `search.py` (aStarSearch function)

### 5. Corners Problem
Solve the Corners Problem, where Pacman needs to find the shortest path that touches all four corners of the maze. Implement a heuristic to optimize this search.

**Files involved**: `search.py`, `searchAgents.py` (CornersProblem, cornersHeuristic)

### 6. Food Search Problem
Solve the Food Search Problem, where Pacman needs to eat all the food dots in the maze using the shortest path. Implement a heuristic to guide the A* search.

**Files involved**: `search.py`, `searchAgents.py` (FoodSearchProblem, foodHeuristic)

## Usage

To run Pacman with a specific search algorithm, use the following commands:

- Depth First Search (DFS):
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=depthFirstSearch
  ```

- Breadth First Search (BFS):
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=breadthFirstSearch
  ```

- Uniform Cost Search (UCS):
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=uniformCostSearch
  ```

- A* Search:
  ```bash
  python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
  ```

You can also run the autograder to test the correctness of your implementations:

```bash
python autograder.py
```
